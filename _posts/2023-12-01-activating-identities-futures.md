# Context
> Activating Identities and Futures (AIF) is a **compulsory SACE Stage 2 subject** designed around innovation, allowing students to explore areas/careers that they are personally interested in. 
> AIF requires students to create and document their progress in their **NEOL (Natural Evidence of Learning) Logbook** towards a '**Learning Goal**', which is rendered as an a final '**Output of Learning**'. Throughout the semester, students intermittently undergo graded Check Ins with their AIF teachers. At the end of the semester, students submit a **SACE-moderated appraisal**, showcasing their Output of Learning and reflecting upon their strategies.

# Reflection 

During AIF, my goal was to develop my skills in Python and object-oriented programming, as well as to explore the software development cycle through making a desktop productivity app. This required to me to seek feedback from other students on my prototypes, fixing bugs and implementing requested features.

*Producing an Outcome*

Since my Output of Learning was an app, I wanted to make my outcome accessible, so I released it as an open-source application [on Github](https://github.com/phthallo/chillist). Creating something that was actually usable contributed to increasing; although it is by no means a perfect product, it acted as a 'proof of concept' and also provided some insight into actual app development (in the way that Python is not the greatest language to use for it haha) 

*Refining Ideas*

The idea of creating a time management program came to me based on reflection of my own procrastination during the Term 2 holidays. However, I ended up using a mind map (this mind map was included in my NEOL logbook) to fully flesh out my ideas.

*Managing Projects*

Part of the way I developed my Output relied on Github's project tool (a kanban-board-esque feature, similar to Trello if you've ever used that) to separate tasks and issues based on priority. This allowed me to focus on things I wished to implement between Check Ins.

Furthermore, I recognised the importance of documenting my work. By nature of the platform (Github) I was using to store my code, I was able to track when I made changes, added new features and added/removed bugs (similar to a 'version history' of the code of sorts). Using it allowed me to increase my familiarity with the platform, as large companies often use Github to store their open-source code. 

*Demonstrating Courage*

In the progress of coding my app, I **sought insight from my target audience of high school students** (primarily Glenunga students, but I did post the survey online to expand my reach) on what features they would be most likely to use. 

However, upon realising that I required more in-depth perspectives, I **contacted a student who had done the survey** to ask them specific questions (at that time, they were a Year 12 at Glenunga) about their organisation/time management techniques. This led me to **incorporate one of their suggestions** (the Eisenhower Task matrix) into my app. 

By reaching out to my target audience and actually seeking user perspectives, I was able to determine focus areas to boost engagement with the app. 


Furthermore, I actively sought contact with some of the volunteer moderators behind an online studying platform (StudyTogether). As the platform is used by over a million students (including myself!), gaining a professional insight into their development of their web application, and how they maintained the codebase and considered new features, was incredibly helpful.

*Developing Integrity*

Beta-testing my app meant I was able to receive constructive criticism from people who were using the app for the first time, providing unique perspectives on the overall demographic using it. Additionally, they also were able to test for bugs, suggest new features and offer their opinions on its aesthetic appeal and usability.

<br>

Completing my AIF project has taught me a significant amount about developing software for a target audience (instead of just myself), and it also has proved as valuable evidence for my portfolio.  In the future, I hope to be able to increase my collaboration with others on other open-source projects; right now, I'm mostly just raising issues and adding feature requests, but being able to contribute code as well would be fantastic.
