A quick to-do list for things I still have to update on this website :)

- [ ] ✍️ Write blog posts for all [Projects](/projects) and replace Github links with blog links. Alternatively, create on-click modal dialog boxes.
- [ ] 🏕️ Add 'Experiences' tab; adjust CSS to accomodate extra tabs <s>(and if possible, add back Tags tab -> remove Home tab?)</s>
- [ ] 📋 Add support for multiple custom panels as defined by frontmatter.
- [x] Fix custom panel stickiness when scrolling to bottom of page
- [x] TOC support for non-post layouts
- [X] Fix image zoom-in when clicking on Projects page
- [X] Dark theme: tables
