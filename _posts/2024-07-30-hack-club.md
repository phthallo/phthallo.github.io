## Context

![alt text](assets/img/posts/hack-website.png)

Hack Club is a non-profit network consisting of thousands of high-school computer programmers and creators. Just last week (at the time I am writing this!) I flew to Canada in order to participate in the [Boreal Express](https://boreal.hackclub.com), a hackathon across the country, travelling in a train and building awesome projects with 49 other hackers. It's an opportunity that I'm immensely grateful for, and I know that I would not have achieved this had I not started showcasing my projects in a portfolio of my own.

During my time there, I built a basic photo gallery intended to hold memories of our time on the Boreal Express, using HTML and CSS with Flask. It was an incredible experience.

## Collective Engagement

This hackathon was unique in that despite being a programming event, we had no Wi-Fi connection -  requiring us to collaborate with fellow hackers and pool together our knowledge (and sometimes, resources) on certain topics. I notably recall the transferral of entire Python packages and 20GB+ programming apps from people's laptops over the server that had been built for us. With the days dedicated to programming and the nights to 'ship showcases' (where projects were demoed), lightning talks and karaoke, the connections formed with the other hackers on the train are ones that I will treasure forever.

Coding is often seen as a solitary activity, but I truly believe that hackathons bring out the collaborative spirit in all of us.

## Personal Enterprise

Outside of in-person hackathons, Hack Club runs large-scale programs for creators of all kinds! This includes Sprig, a you-ship-we-ship (you create a game using the Sprig platform, we'll ship you a Sprig you can build yourself) available internationally. The open-endedness of it all encourages creativity among those who submit games - over 500 games have been submitted so far! 

During the last month, I built and submitted my own game, then constructed my Sprig (see image above) with the provided materials.


# Reflection

Hack Club is amazing. A large number of contributors to its operation (whether that be bug reports and issues or the addition of new features in their entirety) are teenagers  - from the designers and programmers of its websites to the organisers of each hackathon - and it is simply aweinspiring the impact that high schoolers like myself, no matter where they're from, can have on the world. Over the course of this year, I hope to be able to make my own contributions to the future of Hack Club and its community.
