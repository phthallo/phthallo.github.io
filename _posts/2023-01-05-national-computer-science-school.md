---

The **National Computer Science School (NCSS)**, founded in 1996, is an intensive, 10-day annual summer school designed to teach Australian high-school students **fundamentals in computer science and programming**. It is hosted by Grok Academy.  

Two 'streams' run concurrently - the chatbot stream at the University of Melbourne, and the cybersecurity stream at the University of New South Wales. Each stream is comprised of ~80 students, with an additional 20-30 volunteer tutors to guide the group.


Year 11 students are eligible for the next year's intake, with "exceptionally gifted Year 10 students" also encouraged to apply.[^1] I applied as a Year 10 student in 2022 and was accepted for 2023 at the University of Melbourne, having submitted my school grades and a [small programming portfolio](https://github.com/phthallo/code-examples) for consideration. 

Some students who have previously attended NCSS are invited back as returning students/returners for the next year. I attended NCSS in 2024 at the University of New South Wales as a returner.

## Quality Thinking
> Elements
> - Activating curiosity
> - Being creative
> - Analysing and reasoning

With both streams of NCSS involving critical and creative thinking - particularly in regards to the Sydney's cybersecurity stream, where students were encouraged to 'think like hackers', being creative and generating unconventional ideas was certainly a highlight of the summer school. 

Groups were given a historical scenario and had to collectively determine alternate methods or solutions - in my group's case, it was ways of preventing the [1917 Halifax Explosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halifax_Explosion). Generating our solution involved considering what went wrong in the original event, and how potential causes could feasibly be eliminated. This required deep and critical analysis of the original problem.

*Problem solving process is documented in the following video*

## Principled Action
> Elements
> - Embracing diversity
> - Being considerate and caring

Operating in groups of 15-16 to build projects within the span of 10 days required the use of **Principled Action**, with groups separating into teams based on functionality. For the 2023 stream, I was part of the Entertainment team, and helped integrate music, video, and games into my team's chatbot whilst also seeking advice from others with more experience in programming. 

During this time, I had the opportunity to work with people from all over Australia and gain different diverse perspectives, all while building a projcet together.

## Collective Engagement
> ELements
> - Demonstrating respect
> - Inquiring
> - Making contributions

NCSS relies heavily on teamwork across the ten days, culminating in a final project (Melbourne) or a day of 'Wargames' (Sydney). Both streams produce a video summarising their experiences over the year, which is then uploaded (sooner or later) onto the NCSS YouTube channel. 

Sydney's Wargames involves a series of different puzzles, including OSInt (open source intelligence), cipher cracking, lockpicking, "Busy Beaver" programs on a custom microprocessor and logic challenges. This event required proactive contributions and active collaboration within the group to complete the dozens of challenges over the course of the day.

As a returner, I also had the responsibility of guiding newer students in my group and generally being a role model. Returners also produced their own video, which is done in leisure time to avoid disturbing other students.

## Reflection

![alt txt](/assets/img/posts/ncss-afr.png)

Though I first applied for NCSS back in Year 10, it has been something that has stayed with me throughout my senior years of high school - and it has greatly influenced my decision to pursue computer science in university. 
Furthermore, it has introduced me to so many other students who share the same passion for STEM subjects as I do, and has allowed me to network with people from far beyond my own circle.

I have been able to **connect with industry mentors** (Atlassian, Macquarie, Westpac) at formal dinners and programming competitions, **visit the sites of NCSS' sponsors** (Airwallex, NAB, Macquarie, Atlassian, Wisetech Global, Optiver), undergo **mock job interviews** (Atlassian, Macquarie) with current employees and even had the opportunity to feature in a news article by the [Australian Financial Review](https://www.afr.com/work-and-careers/education/software-billionaire-backs-tech-summer-camp-to-win-hearts-and-souls-20240110-p5ewbu). By pursuing my interests, I was able to participate in incredible life-changing opportunties.
