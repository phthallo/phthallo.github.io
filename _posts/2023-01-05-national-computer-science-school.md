>The **National Computer Science School (NCSS)**, founded in 1996, is an intensive, 10-day annual summer school designed to teach Australian high-school students **fundamentals in computer science and programming**. It is hosted by Grok Academy.  
>
>Two 'streams' run concurrently - the chatbot stream at the University of Melbourne, and the cybersecurity stream at the University of New South Wales. Each stream is comprised of ~80 students, with an additional 20-30 volunteer tutors to guide the group.

## Outline 
Year 11 students are eligible for the next year's intake, with "exceptionally gifted Year 10 students" also encouraged to apply.[^1] I applied as a Year 10 student in 2022 and was accepted for 2023 at the University of Melbourne, having submitted my school grades and a [small programming portfolio](https://github.com/phthallo/code-examples) for consideration. 

Some students who have previously attended NCSS are invited back as returning students/returners for the next year. I attended NCSS in 2024 at the University of New South Wales as a returner. 

## Reflection

![alt tzt](/assets/img/posts/ncss-afr.png)

Though I first applied for NCSS back in Year 10, it has been something that has stayed with me throughout my senior years of high school - and it has greatly influenced my decision to pursue computer science in university. 
Furthermore, it has introduced me to so many other students who share the same passion for STEM subjects as I do, and has allowed me to network with people from far beyond my own circle.

I have been able to **connect with industry mentors** (Atlassian, Macquarie, Westpac) at formal dinners and programming competitions, **visit the sites of NCSS' sponsors** (Airwallex, NAB, Macquarie, Atlassian, Wisetech Global, Optiver), undergo **mock job interviews** (Atlassian, Macquarie) with current employees and even had the opportunity to feature in a news article by the [Australian Financial Review](https://www.afr.com/work-and-careers/education/software-billionaire-backs-tech-summer-camp-to-win-hearts-and-souls-20240110-p5ewbu). 


NCSS relies heavily on teamwork across the ten days, culminating in a final project (Melbourne) or a day of 'Wargames' (Sydney). Both streams produce a video summarising their experiences over the year, which is then uploaded (sooner or later) onto the NCSS YouTube channel.

As a returner, I also had the responsibility of guiding newer students in my group and generally being a role model. Returners also produce their own video.
