I have been employed casually at Kmart since last year, working an upwards of 21 hours a week shelving items, tidying up around the store, taking phone calls and serving customers as the checkouts. During that time I've worked reliably with other team members and managers to help and support customers.
Balancing a job at the same time as my Year 12 committments has proved challenging, yet doable, and has required extensive time mangament and organsiational skills.

## Principled Action
> Elements 
> - Developing informed opinions
> - Forming relationships
> - Analysing and reasoning
> - Being considerate and caring

Being able to adapt to the roles that are required on a daily basis is essential as one of the many staff members at a decently sized retail store. This can involve the development of informed opinions when assisting customers with their needs - particularly when the customer does not know what specific item they are searching for. Furthermore, it can involve analysing the situation to identify when to be proactive and seek help from other team members or managers.

## Collective Engagement
> Elements 
> - Demonstrating respect
> - Making contributions

In such a large workplace, collective engagement is essential for optimising work efforts with other employees on the shop floor. Making contributions to the overall work environment - i.e., helping a customer at the service desk during a particularly busy hour, completing a price check for a customer at the checkouts, or even assisting another team member searching for an item - help to improve cohesion and overall customer satisfaction.
