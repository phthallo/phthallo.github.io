I have been employed casually at Kmart since last year, working an upwards of 21 hours a week shelving items, tidying up around the store, folding clothing and taking phone calls. During that time I've worked reliably with other team members and managers to help and support customers.

Balancing a job at the same time as my Year 12 committments has proved challenging, yet doable, and has required extensive time mangament and organsiational skills.
