This year I've participated in two/four-ish programming competitions - the NCSS Challenge (Intermediate Stream) and UNSW's ProgComp.

## NCSS Challenge
- Done online individually across four-five weeks, with a focus on Python 3.6. I completed the Intermediate Stream in early March with a perfect score.

## UNSW ProgComp
- Done in-person in teams of three over a two hour period. Any programming language capable of I/O operations can be used, though my team used Python.
- More competitive-programming oriented - questions require the creation of an algorithm that has to generate a certain output in response to test data - and definitely more challenging than the NCSS Challenge!

## NCSS ProgComp
- Done in-person in teams of three also over a two hour period (?). Again, any programming language could be used, but my team used Python to solve a variety of questions.
- Very similar to UNSW ProgComp and was held at UNSW.

## NCSS CryptoComp
- Done in-person in teams of three over a two hour period. Required logical thinking to crack a variety of ciphers, from basic substitution to enigma codes.
