The Datacom Pathways Program is a pilot program aimed towards high schoolers with an interest in cybersecurity. With the occasional meeting with Fortinet and Datacom mentors, I was able to complete two courses (Fortinet Certified Fundamentals in Cybersecurity and Fortinet Certified Associate in Cybersecurity).

## Self-Motivated Learning

While the certifications were completed with assistance from Fortinet and Datacom staff, they - including all quiz and exam components - were largely done individually, requiring me to **operate with self-direction** in order to complete the content of each section on time.

## Personal Enterprise 

These are both legitimate certifications that I can place on my resume - with the latter also exploring the operation and administration of Fortinet's products. The knowledge gained from this program will benefit me immensely should I ever undertake system administration work in a future technical role, as it is certainly a step outside of my comfort zone.
