The Datacom Pathways Program is a pilot program aimed towards high schoolers with an interest in cybersecurity. With the occasional meeting with Fortinet and Datacom mentors, I was able to complete two courses (Fortinet Certified Fundamentals in Cybersecurity and Fortinet Certified Associate in Cybersecurity). 


These are both legitimate certifications that I can place on my resume - with the latter also exploring the operation and administration of Fortinet's products.
