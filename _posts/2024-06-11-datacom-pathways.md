The Datacom Pathways Program is a pilot program aimed towards high schoolers with an interest in cybersecurity. With the occasional meeting with Fortinet and Datacom mentors, I was able to complete two courses (Fortinet Certified Fundamentals in Cybersecurity and Fortinet Certified Associate in Cybersecurity).

## Self-Motivated Learning

> Elements 
> - Demonstrating initiative
> - Operating with self-direction
> - Demonstrating perseverance 

While the certifications were completed with assistance from Fortinet and Datacom staff, they - including all quizzes and exams - were largely done individually, requiring me to **operate with self-direction** in order to complete the content of each section on time. In addition, the content needed for these certifications was generally quite complex (as they are aimed more towards industry professionals and not high school students), and persererance was required to complete each component to an appropriate standard.

## Personal Enterprise 

> Elements 
> - Taking opportunities
> - Being organised

These are both legitimate certifications that I can place on my resume - with the latter also exploring the operation and administration of Fortinet's products. The knowledge gained from this program will benefit me immensely should I ever undertake system administration work in a future technical role, as it is certainly a step outside of my comfort zone.
