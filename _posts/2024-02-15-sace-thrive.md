| **Holistic Goal** <br> My holistic goal is to **strengthen my portfolio** and to improve my programming skills in preparation for university applications.
- **Programming more in my own time**; working on projects as well as learning important topics (data structures and algorithms)**Immersing myself more in my desired career**; attending more computer science related events this year e.g<br>- **[Pycon](https://2024.pycon.org.au/)**, a conference about the programming language Python which, going by patterns in previous years, is likely to be held in Adelaide sometime this year.<br>- The **[Girls Programming Network](https://www.girlsprogramming.network/adelaide)** - I met a teacher at NCSS who was working on starting a node in Adelaide, since we don't have one (lol) (she told me that events are estimated to begin by the start of Term 2) :D<br>- **[UniSA STEM Girls Academy](https://study.unisa.edu.au/services-for-schools/experiences/curriculum-linked-education/gender-equity-in-stem/stem-girls-academy/)** - signed up for the second year in a row!  <br>- There's also the opportunity to **attend hackathons and do work experience** - recently, a form was sent out looking for expressions of interest for the Datacom Pathways Program (starting by the end of March)<br>- **[NCSS Challenge](https://groklearning.com/challenge/)** - online coding challenge which happens twice a year; there's one going on right now! | 
| **Personal Goal** <br> My personal goal is to improve my **organisation and time management** in order to support my wellbeing through the stress of Year 12 combined with my part time job.
- **Documenting tasks** to be completed <br>- Effectively **time-blocking** - creating a **schedule** of due assignments/shifts at work to constantly refer to.  <br>- Maintaining cleanliness in my desk area/room.<br>- Finding productive study areas (libraries), empty classrooms, breakout rooms if the Year 12 Wing is too loud.<br>- Revising effectively; working on tasks well in advance. |
