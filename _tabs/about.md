Hi, I'm Annabel, also known as phthallo! 

I'm currently in Year 12, studying at **Glenunga International High School** as part of the [IGNITE Specialist program](https://gihs.sa.edu.au/specialist-programs/ignite/). 
Outside of school, though, I'm an avid Doctor Who fan, reader (come chat to me about when *The Winds of Winter* will release), enjoyer of <span data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" data-bs-original-title="Mainly Celeste and Hollow Knight, though I have been enjoying some Rain World recently :3"><u>indie games</u></span>, and sometimes an artist. 


My interests are quite random, but right now, I'm exploring the fields of **software development, machine learning** and **cybersecurity**. When I get around to it, I'm also looking to learn Typescript and Rust :D

A huge shoutout to the <span data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" data-bs-original-title="Melbourne '23 and Sydney '24!">brilliant people at the [National Computer Science School](https://groklearning.com/ncss/)</span> and [Grok Academy](https://groklearning.com/) . I wouldn't be where I am without them.  


Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/phthallo) :) I'd love to hear from you!
