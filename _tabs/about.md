## Annabel Quach
<img src ="/assets/img/dividers/header.png" alt="'[phthallo]' on a background of stars and planets">

Hi, I'm Annabel, also known as phthallo! 

I'm currently in Year 12, studying at **Glenunga International High School** as part of the [IGNITE Specialist program](https://gihs.sa.edu.au/specialist-programs/ignite/). 
Outside of school, though, I'm an avid Doctor Who fan, reader (come chat to me about when *The Winds of Winter* will release), enjoyer of <span data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" data-bs-original-title="Mainly Celeste and Hollow Knight, though I have been enjoying some Rain World recently :3"><u>indie games</u></span>, and sometimes an artist. 


My interests are quite random, but right now, I'm exploring the fields of **software development, machine learning** and **cybersecurity**. When I get around to it, I'm also looking to learn Typescript and Rust :D See my projects by visiting my portfolio [here](/projects) or on my [GitHub](https://github.com/phthallo).

A huge shoutout to the <span data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" data-bs-original-title="Melbourne '23 and Sydney '24!">brilliant people at the [National Computer Science School](https://groklearning.com/ncss/)</span> and [Grok Academy](https://groklearning.com/) . I wouldn't be where I am without them.

## (In)frequently asked questions

#### What does your username mean?
It comes from '**phthalo**', a shade of blue - that word itself is derived from **[phthalocyanine blue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/phthalocyanine)**, an organic compound, and **phthalocyanine** comes from combining '*naptha*' and '*κύανος (kuanos)*' (Ancient Greek for dark blue). So you could say phthalocyanine blue is really just `blue blue blue`.


As for pronunciation, it's contentious, but I go with `thay-low`. 

#### How can I get in touch with you? 
- Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/phthallo) :) I'd love to hear from you! (I don't bite, I promise)
- Alternatively, send me an email at <a href = "javascript:location.href = 'mailto:' + ['annabelquach13','gmail.com'].join('@')">annabelquach13@gmail.com</a>.

#### Where did that picture above come from? 
It's from the [Deep-Fold's Pixel Space Generator](https://deep-fold.itch.io/space-background-generator), using the Rust Gold 8 colour scheme.

(Incidentally, the palette of this site was colour picked from it. Well, technically it was colour picked from a theme that was colour picked from another theme that was colour picked from that image.)
