## Annabel Quach

Hi, I'm Annabel, also known as phthallo! 

I'm currently in Year 12, studying at **Glenunga International High School** as part of the [IGNITE Specialist program](https://gihs.sa.edu.au/specialist-programs/ignite/). 
Outside of school, though, I'm an avid Doctor Who fan, reader (come chat to me about when *The Winds of Winter* will release), enjoyer of <span data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" data-bs-original-title="Mainly Celeste and Hollow Knight, though I have been enjoying some Rain World recently :3"><u>indie games</u></span>, and sometimes an artist. 


My interests are quite random, but right now, I'm exploring the fields of **software development, machine learning** and **cybersecurity**. When I get around to it, I'm also looking to learn Typescript and Rust :D

A huge shoutout to the <span data-bs-toggle="tooltip" data-bs-placement="top" data-bs-original-title="Melbourne '23 and Sydney '24!">brilliant people at the [National Computer Science School](https://groklearning.com/ncss/)</span> and [Grok Academy](https://groklearning.com/) . I wouldn't be where I am without them.  


Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/phthallo) :) I'd love to hear from you!

## In(frequently) asked questions

#### What does your username mean?
It comes from '**phthalo**', a shade of blue - that word itself is derived from **[phthalocyanine blue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/phthalocyanine)**, an organic compound, and **phthalocyanine** comes from combining '*naptha*' and '*κύανος (kuanos)*' (Ancient Greek for dark blue). So you could say phthalocyanine blue is really just `blue blue blue`.


As for pronunciation, it's contentious, but I go with `thay-low`. 

#### Any secrets on this website?
Yes. You probably wouldn't click on it, though.
